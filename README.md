# Automotive-ECU-Communication-System-using-CAN-Protocol.-
This project demonstrates a simple ECU-to-ECU communication setup using the CAN protocol on the LPC2129 microcontroller. One ECU works as the transmitter and sends predefined CAN data frames, while the second ECU receives those frames and performs actions such as controlling LEDs, headlights, and left/right indicators based on the message ID. The project highlights basic CAN initialization, message handling, and real-time response between two microcontrollers, similar to communication used in automotive systems. It is developed using Embedded C on Keil uVision, with an external CAN transceiver for reliable data transfer.
